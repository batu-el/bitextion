# BiTextion

When interacting with automated optimization modeling systems, such as \citet{pmlr-v235-ahmaditeshnizi24a}, the burden of clearly and precisely describing complex problems falls upon the users, which can be challenging, especially for non-experts, who are the primary user base for these systems. This observation motivates our research to develop a system that can ask clarifying questions to help non-expert users precisely describe complex optimization problems. We introduce Textual Bisection (\textsc{BiTextion}), a framework that (i) samples candidate \textit{detailed problem descriptions} conditioned on a \textit{vague problem description}, and (ii) narrows down the search space by posing questions that efficiently resolve ambiguities. Our simulated user study provides experimental evidence showing that \textsc{BiTextion} improves the performance of Llama3.1-8b when eliciting the constraints of an optimization problem. We find that \textsc{BiTextion} can enhance the performance of smaller models but may not consistently deliver similar gains when applied to larger models, underscoring the need for model-specific test-time strategies.
