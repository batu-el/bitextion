## BiTextion: Sociotechnical Alignment in Automated Optimization Modeling via Textual Bisection for Task Disambiguation

**Abstract:** When interacting with automated optimization modeling systems, such as [Optimus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06116), the burden of clearly and precisely describing complex problems falls upon the users, which can be challenging, especially for non-experts, who are the primary user base for these systems. This observation motivates our research to develop a system that can ask clarifying questions to help non-expert users precisely describe complex optimization problems. We introduce Textual Bisection (**BiTextion**), a framework that (i) samples candidate *detailed problem descriptions* conditioned on a *vague problem description*, and (ii) narrows down the search space by posing questions that efficiently resolve ambiguities. Our simulated user study provides experimental evidence showing that **BiTextion** improves the performance of Llama3.1-8b when eliciting the constraints of an optimization problem. We find that **BiTextion** can enhance the performance of smaller models but may not consistently deliver similar gains when applied to larger models, underscoring the need for model-specific test-time strategies.
