  "detailed_description": "The weather is freezing and the fish in the pond need to be transported either by helicopter or car. A helicopter can take \\param{FishPerHelicopter} fish per trip and takes \\param{TimeHelicopter} minutes. A car can take \\param{FishPerCar} fish per trip and takes \\param{TimeCar} minutes. Since helicopter trips are expensive, there can be at most \\param{MaxHelicopterTrips} helicopter trips. In addition, at least \\param{CarTripPercentage} of the trips should be by car.
