  "detailed_description": "A zoo needs to transport their monkeys to the vet either by bus or by car. A bus can transport \\param{BusCapacity} monkeys per trip and takes \\param{BusDuration} minutes. A car can transport \\param{CarCapacity} monkeys per trip and takes \\param{CarDuration} minutes. There can be at most \\param{MaxBusTrips} bus trips. In addition, since the monkeys get aggressive when there are too many in one place at least \\param{MinCarTripProportion} of the trips should be by car. If the zoo needs to transport \\param{TotalMonkeys} monkeys, how many trips of each should be done to minimize the total time required to transport the monkeys?",
