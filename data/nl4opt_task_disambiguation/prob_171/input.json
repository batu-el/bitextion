  "detailed_description": "A mail delivery service in an island village delivers mail by regular and speed boats. A regular boat can carry \\param{RegularCapacity} pieces of mail per trip and uses \\param{RegularFuel} liters of gas. A speed boat can carry \\param{SpeedCapacity} pieces of mail per trip and uses \\param{SpeedFuel} liters of gas. There can be at most \\param{MaxRegularTrips} regular boat trips. Since customers want their mail as fast as possible, at least \\param{MinSpeedPercentage} of the trips must be made by speed boats.
