  "detailed_description": "An artisan makes two types of terracotta jars: a thin jar and a stubby jar. Each thin jar requires \\var{ThinShapingTime} minutes of shaping time and \\var{ThinBakingTime} minutes of baking time.

Per week, there are \\var{TotalShapingTime} minutes available for shaping and \\var{TotalBakingTime} minutes available for baking.
