  "detailed_description": "Jordan is a chef. He wants to design a diet consisting of Kebabs and Rice. Assume that each serving of Rice costs \\var{CostRice} and contains \\var{CalRice} calories and \\var{ProtRice} grams of protein. Assume that each serving of Kebab costs \\var{CostKebab} and contains \\var{CalKebab} calories and \\var{ProtKebab} grams of protein. He's interested in spending as little money as possible but he wants to ensure that his meals have at least \\var{MinCal} calories and at least \\var{MinProt} grams of protein per day. Formulate a linear programming problem that will help minimize the cost of the diet.",
