  "detailed_description": "A dentist has \\param{TotalResin} units of resin to fill cavities in both molars and canines. Molars require \\param{ResinMolar} units of resin and \\param{PainKillerMolar} units of pain killer. Canines require \\param{ResinCanine} units of resin and \\param{PainKillerCanine} units of pain killer. Since this dentist sees more cavities in canines, at least \\param{MinCaninePercentage} of cavities filled must be in canines. In addition, the dentist must reserve materials to fill at least \\param{MinMolars} molars.
