  "detailed_description": "A farmer on an island sends corn to the main land either by ferry or light rail. Each ferry trip can take \\param{FerryCapacity} boxes of corn while each light rail trip can take \\param{RailCapacity} boxes of corn. Since ferry trips are slow, the number of light rail trip has to be at least \\param{MinRailToFerryRatio} times the number of ferry trips. If the farmer wants to send at least \\param{MinCornBoxes} boxes of corn, minimize the total number of trips of either type needed.",
