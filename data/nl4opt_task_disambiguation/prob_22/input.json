  "detailed_description": "A glass factory makes two types of glass panes: a regular glass pane and a tempered glass pane. Both require time on a heating and cooling machine. Both machines are available for a maximum of \\var{MaxTime} minutes per day. It takes \\var{TimeRegHeat} minutes in the heating machine and \\var{TimeRegCool} minutes in the cooling machine to make one regular glass pane. It takes \\var{TimeTempHeat} minutes in the heating machine and \\var{TimeTempCool} minutes in the cooling machine to make one tempered glass pane. The profit per pane of regular glass is \\var{ProfitReg} and the profit per pane of tempered glass is \\var{ProfitTemp}. How many panes of each glass type should the factory make to maximize profit?
