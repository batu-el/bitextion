  "detailed_description": "A water company sells water in glass and plastic bottles. A glass bottle can hold \\param{VolumeGlass} ml of water while a plastic bottle can hold \\param{VolumePlastic} ml of water. Because most customer prefer plastic bottles, the number of plastic bottles must be at least \\param{RatioPlasticToGlass} times the number of glass bottles. However, there must be at least \\param{MinGlassBottles} glass bottles.
