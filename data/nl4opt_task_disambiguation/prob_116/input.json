  "detailed_description": "A pharmacy has two factories, factory 1 and factory 2, where they make acne cream and anti-bacterial cream. Factory 1 produces \\param{AcneFactory1} units of acne cream and \\param{AntibacterialFactory1} units of anti-bacterial cream per hour. Factory 2 produces \\param{AcneFactory2} units of acne cream and \\param{AntibacterialFactory2} units of anti-bacterial cream per hour. Factory 1 requires \\param{BaseGelFactory1} units of base gel per hour while factory 2 requires \\param{BaseGelFactory2} units of base gel per hour. The pharmacy has available \\param{TotalBaseGel} units of base gel. Further, they must make at least \\param{MinAcneCream} units of acne cream and \\param{MinAntibacterialCream} units of anti-bacterial cream.
