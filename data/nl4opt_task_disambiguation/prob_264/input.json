  "vague_description": "A researcher needs to distribute annotation tasks between two companies with different expertise, costs, and deadlines, ensuring a certain proportion is handled by a specialized company while minimizing overall expenses.",
  "detailed_description": "A researcher is outsourcing annotations and has two options: a specialized third-party or a common third-party annotation company. The specialized company can annotate at a rate of \\param{SpecializedRate} images per hour whereas the common company can annotate at a rate of \\param{CommonRate} images per hour. However, the specialized company charges \\param{SpecializedCharge} per hour and the common company charges \\param{CommonCharge} per hour. The researcher has deadlines to meet and must complete a dataset of at least \\param{MinimumImages} images. They also have some special images that only the specialized company can annotate. Therefore, at least a \\param{MinimumSpecializedProportion} of work must be allocated to the specialized company. How should the researcher distribute the annotations to the two companies to minimize the cost of annotating the whole dataset?",

    "At least MinimumSpecializedProportion of the work must be allocated to the specialized company"

  "target_parameters": [
    "Annotation rate of the specialized company",
    "Annotation rate of the common company",
    "Hourly charge of the specialized company",
    "Hourly charge of the common company",
    "Minimum number of images to be annotated",
