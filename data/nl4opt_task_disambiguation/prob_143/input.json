A large pill requires \\param{LargePillMedicinalUnits} units of medicinal ingredients and \\param{LargePillFillerUnits} units of filler. A small pill requires \\param{SmallPillMedicinalUnits} units of medicinal ingredients and \\param{SmallPillFillerUnits} units of filler. The lab has to make at least \\param{MinimumLargePills} large pills.
