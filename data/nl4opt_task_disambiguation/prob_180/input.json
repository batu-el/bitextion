A small keg can hold \\param{SmallKegCapacity} liters of water while a large keg can hold \\param{LargeKegCapacity} liters of water. The salesman has available at most \\param{MaxSmallKegs} small kegs and \\param{MaxLargeKegs} large kegs. Since small kegs are easier to carry, at least \\param{MinSmallLargeRatio} times as many small kegs must be used than large kegs.
