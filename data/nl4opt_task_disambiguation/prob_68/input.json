  "detailed_description": "A cough syrup company sells cough syrup in kids and adult size bottles. A kids size bottle can hold \\param{VolKid} ml of cough syrup while an adult size bottle can hold \\param{VolAdult} ml of cough syrup. Since there is no difference in concentration of medical ingredients between the two bottles, at least \\param{RatioAdultToKids} times as many adult size bottle must be made as kids size bottles. However, at least \\param{MinKidBottles} kids size bottles must be made.
