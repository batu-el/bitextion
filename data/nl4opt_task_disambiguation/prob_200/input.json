  "detailed_description": "A meat processing plant uses two machines, a meat slicer and a meat packer, to make their hams and pork ribs. To produce one batch of hams requires \\param{HamSlicerHours} hours on the meat slicer and \\param{HamPackerHours} hours on the meat packer. To produce one batch of pork ribs requires \\param{RibSlicerHours} hours on the meat slicer and \\param{RibPackerHours} hours on the meat packer.
