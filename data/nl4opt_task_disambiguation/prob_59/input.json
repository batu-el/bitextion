  "detailed_description": "A bubble tea shop sells mango and lychee bubble tea. Each mango bubble tea requires \\var{MangoJuicePerMangoTea} units of mango juice and \\var{TeaPerMangoTea} units of tea. Each lychee bubble tea requires \\var{LycheeJuicePerLycheeTea} units of lychee juice and \\var{TeaPerLycheeTea} units of tea. The shop has available \\var{TotalMangoJuice} units of mango juice and \\var{TotalLycheeJuice} units of lychee juice. At least \\var{MinLycheeRatio} of the bubble teas made must be lychee flavored. However, mango bubble tea sells better and thus the number of mango bubble teas made must be larger than the number of lychee bubble teas made.
