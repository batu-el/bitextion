  "detailed_description": "A clinical firm has two factories, a northern factory and a western factory, where they make expensive anti-itch injections and topical cream. Every hour, the northern factory makes \\param{NorthernInjectionsRate} g of anti-itch injections and \\param{NorthernCreamRate} g of topical cream. Every hour, the western factory makes \\param{WesternInjectionsRate} g of anti-itch injections and \\param{WesternCreamRate} g of topical cream. The northern factory requires \\param{NorthernPlasticRate} units of plastic per hour while the western factory requires \\param{WesternPlasticRate} units of plastic to manufacture the packaging. The clinical firm has available \\param{TotalPlastic} units of plastic. Further, they must make at least \\param{MinInjections} g of anti-itch injections and \\param{MinCream} g of topical cream.
