  "detailed_description": "A tourist spot in the mountains allows visitors to travel to the top either by hot-air balloon or gondola lift. A hot air balloon can carry \\param{BalloonCapacity} visitors while a gondola lift can carry \\param{GondolaCapacity} visitors. Each hot air balloon produces \\param{BalloonPollution} units of pollution while each gondola lift produces \\param{GondolaPollution} units of pollution. There can be at most \\param{MaxBalloons} hot-air balloon rides and at least \\param{MinVisitors} visitors need to be transported. How many of each type of transport method should be taken to minimize the total pollution produced?",
