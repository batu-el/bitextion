  "detailed_description": "A disease testing station is conducting a temperature check and/or a blood test on each patient. A temperature check takes \\param{TemperatureCheckTime} minutes while a blood test takes \\param{BloodTestTime} minutes. The disease testing station must conduct at least \\param{MinBloodTests} blood tests. Since the temperature check is recommended to be performed on most people, the testing station requires that the temperature check is performed at least \\param{TemperatureBloodTestFactor} times as many as the blood test.
