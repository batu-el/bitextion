  "detailed_description": "A farmer wants to manufacture a special plant nutrition using fertilizers A and B. Each kg of fertilizer A contains \\var{NitrogenA} units of nitrogen, \\var{PhosphoricA} units of phosphoric acid, \\var{VitaminAA} units of vitamin A and \\var{VitaminDA} units of vitamin D. Each kg of fertilizer B contains \\var{NitrogenB} units of nitrogen, \\var{PhosphoricB} units of phosphoric acid, \\var{VitaminAB} units of vitamin A and \\var{VitaminDB} units of vitamin D. To be effective, the plant nutrition requires a minimum \\var{MinNitrogen} units of nitrogen, a minimum of \\var{MinPhosphoric} units of phosphoric acid, and no more than \\var{MaxVitaminA} units of vitamin A. How many kg of each fertilizer should be used to minimize the amount of vitamin D in the nutrition? What is the minimum amount of vitamin D?",
