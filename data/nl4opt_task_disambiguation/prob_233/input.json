  "detailed_description": "An oil and gas company has two types of pipes, a high-volume and a low-volume one. Every day, the high-volume pipe allows \\param{HighVolumeCapacity} US gallons and it is recommended that \\param{HighVolumeTechs} technicians closely monitor the pipes to ensure that it is functioning properly. Each day, the low-volume pipe allows \\param{LowVolumeCapacity} US gallons and \\param{LowVolumeTechs} technicians should closely monitor for safety reasons. Every day, the oil and gas company needs to meet the demands of at least \\param{Demand} US gallons of gas and they have \\param{TotalTechs} technicians that are on their staff. Since the high-volume pipe has a higher risk of environmental damage, at most \\param{MaxHighVolumePercent} percent of the pipes can be high-volume ones. Additionally, there must be a minimum of \\param{MinLowVolumePipes} low-volume pipes. How many of each pipe types should be used to reduce the total number of pipes required?",
