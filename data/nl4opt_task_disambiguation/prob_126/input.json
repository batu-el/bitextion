  "detailed_description": "A pharmacy makes eye cream and foot cream using two different machines, machine 1 and machine 2. Machine 1 can make \\param{EyeMachine1} ml of eye cream and \\param{FootMachine1} ml of foot cream per hour. Machine 2 can make \\param{EyeMachine2} ml of eye cream and \\param{FootMachine2} ml of foot cream per hour. Furthermore, machine 1 requires \\param{WaterMachine1} ml of distilled water per hour while machine 2 requires \\param{WaterMachine2} ml of distilled water per hour. The pharmacy has available \\param{TotalWater} ml of distilled water.
