  "detailed_description": "A hospital purchases two pills available for the patients to take one at a time. One pill is taken as a prevention and another is taken for treatment. The prevention pill takes \\param{PreventionPillCost} dollars to make while the treatment pill takes \\param{TreatmentPillCost} dollars to make. Since the prevention pill is in higher demand, the hospital must purchase at least \\param{PreventionTreatmentRatio} times as many prevention pills as treatment pills. In addition, the hospital must purchase at least \\param{MinTreatmentPills} treatment pills.
