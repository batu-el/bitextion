  "detailed_description": "A doctor's office takes the temperature of patients one by one either by using an electronic or regular thermometer. The electronic thermometer takes \\param{TimeElectronic} minutes to make a reading while the regular thermometer takes \\param{TimeRegular} minutes to make a reading. Since the electronic thermometer is more accurate, at least \\param{RatioElectronicRegular} times as many patients should have their temperature checked by the electronic thermometer than the regular thermometer. Since the electronic thermometer has a cooldown time, at least \\param{MinPatientsRegular} patients should have their temperature checked by a regular thermometer. If the office is open for \\param{TotalTime} minutes, maximize the number of patients whose temperature can be taken?",
