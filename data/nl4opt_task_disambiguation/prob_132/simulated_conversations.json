  "detailed_description": "In a science club, there are two tables that can be set up to make slime. At table 1, \\param{Powder1} units of powder and \\param{Glue1} units of glue are used to make \\param{Slime1} units of slime. At table 2, \\param{Powder2} units of powder and \\param{Glue2} units of glue are used to make \\param{Slime2} units of slime. However, table 1 produces \\param{Mess1} units of mess while table 2 produces \\param{Mess2} units of mess. The science club has available \\param{TotalPowder} units of powder and \\param{TotalGlue} units of glue. If at most \\param{MaxMess} units of mess can be made, how many of each table should be set up to maximize the amount of slime produced?",
