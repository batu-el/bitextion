  "detailed_description": "A mall buys two types of hand sanitizer machines, a motion activated one and a manual one. The motion activated one can deliver \\param{MotionDropsPerMinute} drops per minute and consumes \\param{MotionConsumption} kWh. The manual one can deliver \\param{ManualDropsPerMinute} drops per minute and consumes \\param{ManualConsumption} kWh. Since the motion activated one is more hygienic, at most \\param{MaxManualFraction} of the machines can be manual. In addition, at least \\param{MinMotionMachines} should be motion activated. If the mall must be able to deliver at least \\param{MinDropsPerMinute} drops per minute and can use at most \\param{MaxEnergyPerMinute} kWh per minute, how many of each machine should they buy to minimize the total number of machines?",
