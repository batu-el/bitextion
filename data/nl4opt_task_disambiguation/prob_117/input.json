  "detailed_description": "A doctor recommends that a man eat burgers and pizza in order to put on weight. Each burger contains \\param{FatPerBurger} units of fat and \\param{CaloriesPerBurger} calories. Each slice of pizza contains \\param{FatPerPizzaSlice} units of fat and \\param{CaloriesPerPizzaSlice} calories. The man must get at least \\param{MinFat} units of fat and \\param{MinCalories} calories. Further, each burger contains \\param{CholesterolPerBurger} units of cholesterol while each slice of pizza contains \\param{CholesterolPerPizzaSlice} units of cholesterol. Since burgers are slightly more expensive, the man decides to eat at least \\param{PizzaBurgerRatio} times as many slices of pizza as burgers. How many of each should he eat to minimize his cholesterol intake?",
