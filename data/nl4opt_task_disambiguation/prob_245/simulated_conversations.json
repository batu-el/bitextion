  "detailed_description": "A cruise company can either have two types of trips, a large cruise ship or a small cruise ship. A large cruise ship trip can carry \\param{LargeShipCapacity} customers and produces \\param{LargeShipPollution} units of pollution. A small cruise ship trip can carry \\param{SmallShipCapacity} customers and produces \\param{SmallShipPollution} units of pollution. There can be at most \\param{MaxLargeShipTrips} large cruise ship trips and at least \\param{MinSmallShipTripPercent} of the total trips must be made by small cruise ships.
