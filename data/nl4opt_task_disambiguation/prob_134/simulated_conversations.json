Each slice of cheesecake contains \\param{CalCheesecake} calories and \\param{SugarCheesecake} grams of sugar. Each slice of caramel cake contains \\param{CalCaramelCake} calories and \\param{SugarCaramelCake} grams of sugar. He prefers cheesecake and decides to eat at least \\param{CheeseCaramelRatio} times as many slices of cheesecake as caramel cake. However, he must also eat at least \\param{MinCaramel} slices of caramel cake. If he can consume at most \\param{MaxCalories} calories in one day, how many slices of each cake should he eat to maximize the total amount of sugar he consumes?",
