  "detailed_description": "A mask making company ships masks to their retail stores using small boxes and large boxes. A small box holds \\param{SmallBoxCapacity} masks whereas a large box holds \\param{LargeBoxCapacity} masks. Since small boxes are easier to stack and will be used first to stock stores, there must be at least \\param{MinSmallToLargeRatio} times as many small boxes as large boxes. Additionally, at least \\param{MinLargeBoxes} large boxes must be used. If at least \\param{MinMasksRequired} masks are required to be distributed, how many of each size of box should be used to minimize the total number of boxes needed?",
