  "detailed_description": "A chemical plant can buy two types of generators, generator A and generator B, which use two different processes to generate hydrogen. Generator A uses an electrolysis process and produces \\param{HydrogenA} cubic meters of hydrogen as well as \\param{PollutantsA} units of pollutants every day. Generator B uses a fermentation process to produce \\param{HydrogenB} cubic meters of hydrogen per day while outputting \\param{PollutantsB} units of pollutants. The chemical plant must make a minimum of \\param{MinHydrogen} cubic meters of hydrogen per day but due to environmental restrictions they can produce at most \\param{MaxPollutants} units of pollutant. How many of each type of generator should they buy to minimize the number of generators needed?",
