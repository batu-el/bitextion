  "detailed_description": "A teddy bear company produces three different colored bears: black, white, and brown. These bears are made in two different factories. Running factory 1 for 1 hour costs \\var{CostF1} and produces \\var{BlackF1} black teddy bears, \\var{WhiteF1} white teddy bears, and \\var{BrownF1} brown ones. Running factory 2 for 1 hour costs \\var{CostF2} and produces \\var{BlackF2} black teddy bears and \\var{WhiteF2} white teddy bears (but no brown ones). To meet children's demand, at least \\var{MinBlack} black teddy bears, \\var{MinWhite} white teddy bears, and \\var{MinBrown} brown teddy bears must be made daily. Given this information, develop a linear programming problem assuming the teddy bear company wants to minimize the cost of production.",
