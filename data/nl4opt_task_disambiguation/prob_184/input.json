  "detailed_description": "A factory transports rice to the city in horse-drawn carts that are either medium or large size. A medium sized cart requires \\param{HorsesPerMediumCart} horses and can carry \\param{CapacityMediumCart} kg of rice. A large sized cart requires \\param{HorsesPerLargeCart} horses and can carry \\param{CapacityLargeCart} kg of rice. The factory has \\param{TotalHorses} horses available. Because the horses don't get along well, the number of medium sized carts must be \\param{CartRatio} times the number of large sized carts.
