Each tank of light oil produces a net revenue of \\param{RevenueLight}, each tank of non-sticky oil produces a net revenue of \\param{RevenueNonSticky}, and each tank of heavy oil produces a net revenue of \\param{RevenueHeavy}. To process a tank of light oil, \\param{CompoundALight} units of compound A and \\param{CompoundBLight} units of compound B are required. To process a tank of non-sticky oil, \\param{CompoundANonSticky} units of compound A and \\param{CompoundBNonSticky} units of compound B are required.
