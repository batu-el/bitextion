  "detailed_description": "Maple Oil processes three types of crude oil: light oil, non-sticky oil and heavy oil. Each tank of light oil produces a net revenue of \\param{RevenueLight}, each tank of non-sticky oil produces a net revenue of \\param{RevenueNonSticky}, and each tank of heavy oil produces a net revenue of \\param{RevenueHeavy}. To process a tank of light oil, \\param{CompoundALight} units of compound A and \\param{CompoundBLight} units of compound B are required. To process a tank of non-sticky oil, \\param{CompoundANonSticky} units of compound A and \\param{CompoundBNonSticky} units of compound B are required. To process a tank of heavy oil, \\param{CompoundAHeavy} units of compound A and \\param{CompoundBHeavy} units of compound B are required. Currently the company has \\param{TotalCompoundA} units of compound A and \\param{TotalCompoundB} units of compound B to process. How many full or partial tanks of each oil should the company process so that net revenue is maximized?",
