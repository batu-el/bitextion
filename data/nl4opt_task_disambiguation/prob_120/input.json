  "detailed_description": "A patient can be hooked up to two machines to have medicine delivered, machine 1 and machine 2. Machine 1 delivers \\param{MedicineHeartMachine1} units of medicine to the heart per minute and \\param{MedicineBrainMachine1} units of medicine per minute to the brain. Machine 2 delivers \\param{MedicineHeartMachine2} units of medicine per minute to the heart and \\param{MedicineBrainMachine2} units of medicine per minute to the brain. In addition, machine 1 creates \\param{WasteMachine1} units of waste per minute while machine 2 creates \\param{WasteMachine2} units of waste per minute. If at most \\param{MaxMedicineHeart} units of medicine can be received by the heart and at least \\param{MinMedicineBrain} units of medicine should be received by the brain, how many minutes should each machine be used to minimize the total amount of waste produced?",
