  "detailed_description": "A vine company sells vine in vintage and regular bottles. A vintage bottle can hold \\param{VintageVolume} ml of vine while a regular bottle can hold \\param{RegularVolume} ml of vine. The company has available \\param{TotalVolume} ml of vine. Because vintage bottles are mostly bought by collectors, the number of regular bottles must be at least \\param{MinRegularVintageRatio} times as much as the number of vintage bottles. However, at least \\param{MinVintageBottles} vintage bottles must be made. How many of each should be made to maximize the total number of bottles produced?",
