A dual model stamping machine can stamp \\param{DualCap} letters per minute while a single model stamping machine can stamp \\param{SingleCap} letters per minute. The dual model stamping machine requires \\param{DualGlue} units of glue per minute while the single model stamping machine requires \\param{SingleGlue} units of glue per minute.
