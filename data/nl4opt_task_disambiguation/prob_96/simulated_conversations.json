  "detailed_description": "A small chocolate shop makes milk chocolate and dark chocolate bars. Milk chocolate bars require \\param{CocoaMilk} units of cocoa and \\param{MilkMilk} units of milk. Dark chocolate bars require \\param{CocoaDark} units of cocoa and \\param{MilkDark} units of milk. The shop has \\param{TotalCocoa} units of cocoa and \\param{TotalMilk} units of milk available. In addition, since milk chocolate sells better, at least \\param{MilkDarkRatio} times as many milk chocolate bars need to be made as dark chocolate bars. If making a milk chocolate bar takes \\param{TimeMilk} minutes and making a dark chocolate bar takes \\param{TimeDark} minutes, how many of each should they make to minimize total production time?",
