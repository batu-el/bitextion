  "detailed_description": "A burger chain is buying both gas and electric grills to make burger patties. A gas grill can cook \\param{PattiesGas} patties per minute while an electric grill can cook \\param{PattiesElectric} patties per minute. The gas grill requires \\param{OilGas} units of cooking oil per minute while the electric grill requires \\param{OilElectric} units of cooking oil per minute. Since the gas grill patties taste better, the number of electric grills must be less than the number of gas grills.
