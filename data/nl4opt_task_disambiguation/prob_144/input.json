  "detailed_description": "Both chlorine and water softener need to be added to a pool. One unit of chlorine takes \\param{ChlorineTime} minutes to be effective while one unit of water softener takes \\param{WaterSoftenerTime} minutes to be effective. Because too much chlorine can burn your eyes, there has to at most \\param{ChlorineSoftenerRatio} times as much chlorine as water softener in the pool. If there has to be at least \\param{MinChlorine} units of chlorine in the water and a total of \\param{TotalChemicals} units of chemicals in the water, how many units of each should be added to minimize the total time it takes for the pool to be ready? (Note: chlorine must be added before water softener or vice versa).",

  "target_constraints": [
    "Both the number of chlorine and water softener units are non-negative",
