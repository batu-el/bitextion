  "detailed_description": "A chemical company uses two tests, a salinity test and a pH test. Each unit of the salinity test requires \\param{ProbesSalinity} probes. Whereas each unit of the pH test requires \\param{ProbesPH} probes. The chemical company must perform at least \\param{MinPHTests} pH tests. In total, at least \\param{MinTotalTests} tests must be performed. Further, because of the importance of the salinity test, there must be at most \\param{MaxPHSalinityRatio} times more pH tests than salinity tests. How many times should each test be performed to minimize the total number of probes used?",
