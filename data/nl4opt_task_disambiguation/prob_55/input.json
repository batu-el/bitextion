  "vague_description": "The goal is to determine the optimal allocation of farming resources to process hay while adhering to fuel and methane emission constraints.",
  "detailed_description": "A farmer has \\(\\var{TotalAcres}\\) acres of land on which he must process hay using either a windrower or hay harvester. For each acre of land, the windrower can process \\(\\var{HayWindrower}\\) kg of hay while the hay harvester can process \\(\\var{HayHarvester}\\) kg of hay. Per acre, the windrower produces \\(\\var{MethaneWindrower}\\) kg of methane gas and requires \\(\\var{FuelWindrower}\\) kg of fuel. On the other hand, the hay harvester produces \\(\\var{MethaneHarvester}\\) kg of methane gas per acre and requires \\(\\var{FuelHarvester}\\) kg of fuel. There are \\(\\var{TotalFuel}\\) kg of fuel available and the farmer can produce at most \\(\\var{MaxMethane}\\) kg of methane gas. For how many acres should each machine be used to maximize the amount of hay processed?",
