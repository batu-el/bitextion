  "detailed_description": "A company in the desert can transport goods to rural cities either by camel caravans or desert trucks. A camel caravan can deliver \\param{UnitsCamel} units of goods per trip and takes \\param{TimeCamel} hours. A desert truck can deliver \\param{UnitsTruck} units of goods per trip and takes \\param{TimeTruck} hours. However, due to the cost of fuel, the company prefers to have more camel caravans than desert trucks. If the company needs to deliver \\param{GoodsTotal} units of goods, how many of each method of transportation should the company organize to minimize the total number of hours required?",
  "target_objective": "Minimize the total number of hours to deliver GoodsTotal units of goods",
  "target_constraints": [
    "Number of camel caravans is non-negative",
    "Number of desert trucks is non-negative",
    "Total units delivered by camel caravans and desert trucks must be at least GoodsTotal"
  ],
  "target_parameters": [
    "Number of units of goods delivered per trip by camel caravan",
    "Travel time per trip for camel caravan",
    "Number of units of goods delivered per trip by desert truck",
    "Travel time per trip for desert truck",
