  "detailed_description": "A dim sum restaurant can deliver their food by cart or by hand. Servers can deliver by cart and have \\param{InteractionsCart} customer interactions and will have to refill food \\param{RefillsCart} times an hour. They can also deliver more food by hand, due to the increased mobility, and have \\param{InteractionsHand} customer interactions while refilling food \\param{RefillsHand} times an hour. However, the customers get more options when delivering by cart, therefore at least \\param{MinCartShiftsPercentage} of delivery shifts must be by cart. There must be at least \\param{MinServersHand} servers delivering by hand for their direct customer service.
