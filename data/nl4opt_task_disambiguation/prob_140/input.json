  "vague_description": "The challenge is to balance the dosage of radiation from two beams to ensure the tumor receives sufficient treatment without exceeding the prescribed limits for other sensitive tissues.",
  "detailed_description": "A patient is undergoing radiation treatment involving two beams, Beam 1 and Beam 2. Beam 1 delivers a dose of \\param{DosePancreas1} units of medicine per minute to the benign area of the pancreas and \\param{DoseSkin1} units of medicine per minute to the benign area of the skin. Beam 2 delivers \\param{DosePancreas2} units of medicine per minute to the benign area of the pancreas and \\param{DoseSkin2} units of medicine per minute to the benign area of the skin. In addition, beam 1 delivers \\param{DoseTumor1} units of medicine per minute to the tumor and beam 2 delivers \\param{DoseTumor2} units of medicine per minute to the tumor. At most \\param{MaxSkinDose} units of medicine should be received by the skin and at least \\param{MinTumorDose} units of medicine should be delivered to the tumor. How many minutes of each beam should be used to minimize the total radiation received by the pancreas?",
