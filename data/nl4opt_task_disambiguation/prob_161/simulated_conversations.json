  "detailed_description": "A toy store decides to deliver gifts using two shipping companies, a new one and an old one. The new company can deliver \\param{GiftsNew} gifts per trip while the old company can deliver \\param{GiftsOld} gifts per trip. The new company uses \\param{DieselNew} liters of diesel per trip while the old company uses \\param{DieselOld} liters of diesel per trip. The toy store needs to deliver at least \\param{MinGifts} gifts. There can be at most \\param{MaxTripsNew} trips made by the new company. In order to make sure that the old company does not go out of business, at least \\param{MinPercentOld} of all trips must be made by the old company.
