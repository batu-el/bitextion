The stand makes x1 regular tacos at a profit of \\param{ProfitRegular} each and x2 deluxe tacos at a profit of \\param{ProfitDeluxe} each (x1 and x2 are unknown variables both greater than or equal to 0). There is a demand for at most \\param{DemandRegularMax} regular tacos and at most \\param{DemandDeluxeMax} deluxe tacos. The stand only has enough supplies to sell at most \\param{SupplyTotalMax} tacos of either type. How many of each taco should the stand make to maximize profit?",
