  "detailed_description": "Both subsoil and topsoil need to be added to a garden bed. One bag of subsoil requires \\param{SubsoilWater} units of water to hydrate while one bag of topsoil requires \\param{TopsoilWater} units of water to hydrate every day. The truck used to transport the dirt has limited capacity and therefore, the farmer has available \\param{TotalBags} bags of topsoil and subsoil combined. In addition, at least \\param{MinTopsoil} bags of topsoil must be used. Since the topsoil is more expensive, at most \\param{MaxTopsoilProportion} of all bags of soil can be topsoil.
