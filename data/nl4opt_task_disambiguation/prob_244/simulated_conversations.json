  "detailed_description": "A metal-working shop has access to two types of metal-working equipment, a chop saw and a steel cutter. A chop saw can work \\param{PoundsChopSaw} pounds of steel and generates \\param{WasteChopSaw} units of waste every day. A steel cutter can only cut \\param{PoundsSteelCutter} pounds of steel and generates \\param{WasteSteelCutter} units of waste every day. The metal-working shop is expecting an increase in demand and must cut \\param{TotalPounds} pounds of metal every day. However, there is a waste limitation due to the fines that may be in place if too much heavy metal is discarded and they may at most produce \\param{MaxWaste} units of waste every day. How should the metal-working shop purchase their metal-working equipment to decrease the total number of metal-working equipment needed?",
  "target_objective": "Minimize the total number of metal-working equipment needed by the shop",
  "target_constraints": [
    "Number of chop saws is non-negative",
    "Number of steel cutters is non-negative",
    "The total pounds of metal cut daily must meet or exceed TotalPounds",
    "Total waste produced must not exceed MaxWaste units per day"
  ],
  "target_parameters": [
    "Pounds of steel worked by the chop saw per day",
    "Units of waste generated by the chop saw per day",
    "Pounds of steel worked by the steel cutter per day",
    "Units of waste generated by the steel cutter per day",
    "Total pounds of steel required to be worked per day",
