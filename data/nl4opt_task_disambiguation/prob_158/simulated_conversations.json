  "detailed_description": "A school is organizing a field trip to a science center and wants to hire small buses (each with a capacity of \\param{SmallBusCapacity} students) and large buses (each with a capacity of \\param{LargeBusCapacity} students). The school needs to provide transportation for at least \\param{MinStudents} students. In addition, since the parking lot is rather small, a maximum of \\param{MaxLargeBusProportion} of the buses can be large buses. How many of each type of bus should be hired to minimize the total number of buses?",

    "The number of small buses is non-negative",
    "The number of large buses is non-negative",
    "The total number of students transported must be at least MinStudents",
    "The number of large buses cannot exceed MaxLargeBusProportion times the total number of buses"
