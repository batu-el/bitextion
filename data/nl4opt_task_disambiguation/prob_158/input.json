  "detailed_description": "A school is organizing a field trip to a science center and wants to hire small buses (each with a capacity of \\param{SmallBusCapacity} students) and large buses (each with a capacity of \\param{LargeBusCapacity} students). The school needs to provide transportation for at least \\param{MinStudents} students.
