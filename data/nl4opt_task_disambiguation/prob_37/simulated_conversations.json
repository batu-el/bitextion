  "detailed_description": "A food truck owner can spend at most \\var{MaxBudget} on mangos and guavas. A mango costs the food truck owner \\var{CostMango} and a guava costs him \\var{CostGuava}. Spices are added and each mango is sold for a profit of \\var{ProfitMango} while each guava is sold for a profit of \\var{ProfitGuava}. The owner estimates that at least \\var{MinMangos} mangos but at the most \\var{MaxMangos} are sold each month. He also estimates that the number of guavas sold is at most a third of the mangos sold (expressed as \\var{RatioGuavas} times the number of mangos).
