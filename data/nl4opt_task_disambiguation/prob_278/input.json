  "detailed_description": "A tourism company can buy sedans or buses to add to their fleet of vehicles to increase their capacity for more tourists. A sedan can seat \\param{SedanCapacity} tourists per day but results in \\param{SedanPollution} units of pollution. A bus can seat \\param{BusCapacity} tourists per day but results in \\param{BusPollution} units of pollution. The city has limited this tourism company to producing at most \\param{MaxPollution} units of pollutants per day. To make a profit, this tourism company must take care of at least \\param{MinCustomers} customers per day. Planning to make a profit, how many sedans and how many buses should this tourism company purchase to decrease the total number of vehicles needed?",
