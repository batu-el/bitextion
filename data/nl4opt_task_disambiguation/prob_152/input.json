  "detailed_description": "There has been an oil spill in the ocean and ducks need to be taken to shore to be cleaned either by boat or by canoe. A boat can take \\param{DucksPerBoat} ducks per trip while a canoe can take \\param{DucksPerCanoe} ducks per trip. Since the boats are motor powered, they take \\param{TimePerBoat} minutes per trip while the canoes take \\param{TimePerCanoe} minutes per trip. In order to avoid further environmental damage, there can be at most \\param{MaxBoatTrips} boat trips and at least \\param{MinCanoeTripsPercentage} of the trips should be by canoe. If at least \\param{MinDucks} ducks need to be taken to shore, how many of each transportation method should be used to minimize the total amount of time needed to transport the ducks?",
