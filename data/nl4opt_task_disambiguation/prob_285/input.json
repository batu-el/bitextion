  "detailed_description": "A park is designing their trails and can either create a wide trail or a narrow trail. A wide trail can take \\param{WideCapacity} visitors every day while the narrow trail expects \\param{NarrowCapacity} visitors every day. The wide trail will introduce \\param{WideGarbage} units of garbage and the narrow trail will introduce \\param{NarrowGarbage} units of garbage. There can be at most \\param{MaxWideTrails} wide trails and the park hopes to have at most \\param{MaxCapacity} visitors every day. How many of each type of trail should the park construct to minimize the total amount of garbage produced.",
