  "detailed_description": "A restaurant has two combos available to their customers, an original and an experimental meal. The original meal typically generates \\param{WasteFoodOriginal} units of food waste and \\param{WasteWrapOriginal} units of wrapping waste and takes \\param{TimeOriginal} minutes to cook. In comparison, the experimental meal generates \\param{WasteFoodExperimental} units of food waste and \\param{WasteWrapExperimental} units of wrapping waste and takes \\param{TimeExperimental} minutes to cook. The restaurant can have at most \\param{MaxWrapWaste} units of wrapping waste and can have at most \\param{MaxFoodWaste} units of food waste as regulated by the government.
