  "detailed_description": "A clothing company can sell their product in two types of stores, a retail store and a factory outlet. A retail store brings in \\param{RetailCustomers} customers every day and requires \\param{RetailEmployees} employees to operate. A factory outlet brings in \\param{OutletCustomers} customers every day and due to the lower traffic and being in more remote areas, requires \\param{OutletEmployees} employees to run. Company executives decided that there must be at least \\param{MinCustomers} customers every day, and can make available \\param{TotalEmployees} employees. How should the company distribute their product to the two types of store to reduce the number of stores that must be open?",
