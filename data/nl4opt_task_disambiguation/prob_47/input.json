A batch of croissants is more complicated, so while they take \\var{CroissantOvenTime} hours of oven time, they take \\var{CroissantChefTime} hours of pastry chef time. In a day, the bakery has at most \\var{TotalOvenHours} hours available for the oven and \\var{TotalChefHours} pastry chef hours available.
