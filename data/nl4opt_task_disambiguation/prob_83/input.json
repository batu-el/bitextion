  "detailed_description": "An airport buys two types of vehicles, a 4-wheeler and 3-wheeler, to help move luggage. A 4-wheeler vehicle can move \\param{CapacityFourWheeler} luggage per day and produces \\param{PollutionFourWheeler} units of pollutant per day. A 3-wheeler vehicle can move \\param{CapacityThreeWheeler} luggage per day and produces \\param{PollutionThreeWheeler} units of pollutant per day. The airport needs to be able to move at least \\param{MinLuggageCapacity} luggage per day. To avoid over-polluting the airport, they can produce at most \\param{MaxPollution} units of pollutant per day.
