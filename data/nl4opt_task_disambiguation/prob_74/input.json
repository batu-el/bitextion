  "vague_description": "Determine the optimal combination of two methods of wood burning to maximize the production of carbon dioxide given limited resources.",
  "detailed_description": "In order to make carbon dioxide, wood is burned using two processes, with a catalyst and without a catalyst. The process with a catalyst requires \\param{W_catalyst} units of wood and \\param{O_catalyst} units of oxygen to make \\param{CO2_catalyst} units of carbon dioxide. The process without a catalyst requires \\param{W_no_catalyst} units of wood and \\param{O_no_catalyst} units of oxygen to make \\param{CO2_no_catalyst} units of carbon dioxide. There are \\param{Wood_total} units of wood and \\param{Oxygen_total} units of oxygen available. How many of each process should be used to maximize the amount of carbon dioxide produced?",
