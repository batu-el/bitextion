  "detailed_description": "A suspicious factory has \\var{S} sq. feet of space. It makes bootleg phones and laptops. Phones require \\var{LPhone} hours of labor and cost \\var{CPhone} for each sq. foot of space allocated for phone production (cost of electricity and equipment). Laptops require \\var{LLaptop} hours of labor and cost \\var{CLaptop} for each sq. foot of space allocated for laptop production. Phones produce a net revenue of \\var{RPhone} per sq. foot while laptops produce a net revenue of \\var{RLaptop} per sq. foot. The factory wants to spend at most \\var{BudgetMax} and \\var{LaborMax} hours of labor. What is the optimal factory layout to maximize revenue?",
