  "detailed_description": "Forest Paper makes two types of products: graph paper and music paper. Each type of paper requires the use of two machines, a printing machine and a scanning machine. It takes \\param{TimePrintingGraph} minutes on the printing machine and \\param{TimeScanningGraph} minutes on the scanning machine to make a ream of graph paper. On the other hand, it takes \\param{TimePrintingMusic} minutes on the printing machine and \\param{TimeScanningMusic} minutes on the scanning machine to make a ream of music paper. Each machine is available for a maximum of \\param{MaxTimePrinting} minutes (printing machine) and \\param{MaxTimeScanning} minutes (scanning machine) per day. The company sells a package of graph paper at a profit of \\param{ProfitGraph} and a package of music paper at a profit of \\param{ProfitMusic}. The company can sell all the paper it makes. How many reams of each type should the company produce in a day in order to maximize profit? What is that profit?",
