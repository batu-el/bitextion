  "vague_description": "The challenge is to determine the optimal number of oranges and grapefruits to consume in order to meet specific vitamin requirements while minimizing sugar intake, given the constraints of vitamin content and fruit preference ratio.",
  "detailed_description": "A doctor suggests that his patient eat oranges and grapefruit to meet his vitamin \\param{MinVitaminC} and \\param{MinVitaminA} requirements. One orange contains \\param{VitaminCOrange} units of vitamin C, \\param{VitaminAOrange} units of vitamin A, and \\param{SugarOrange} grams of sugar. One grapefruit contains \\param{VitaminCGrapefruit} units of vitamin C, \\param{VitaminAGrapefruit} units of vitamin A, and \\param{SugarGrapefruit} grams of sugar. The patient must get at least \\param{MinVitaminC} units of vitamin C and \\param{MinVitaminA} units of vitamin A. Since the patient prefers oranges, he must eat at least \\param{OrangeGrapefruitRatio} times as many oranges as grapefruits. How many of each should he eat to minimize his sugar intake?",
