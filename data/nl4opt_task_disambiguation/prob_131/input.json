Each banana contains \\param{BananaCalories} calories, \\param{BananaPotassium} grams of potassium, and \\param{BananaSugar} grams of sugar. Each mango contains \\param{MangoCalories} calories, \\param{MangoPotassium} grams of potassium, and \\param{MangoSugar} grams of sugar. The gorilla must consume at least \\param{MinCalories} calories and \\param{MinPotassium} grams of potassium. Since the gorilla prefers bananas, at most \\param{MaxMangoPercentage} of the fruits he eats can be mangoes. If excess sugar makes the gorilla aggressive, how many of each fruit should he consume to minimize his sugar intake?",
