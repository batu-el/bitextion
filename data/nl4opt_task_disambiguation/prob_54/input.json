  "detailed_description": "A woodshop can purchase two types of saws, a miter saw and a circular saw. A miter saw can cut \\var{MiterPlanks} planks of wood and produces \\var{MiterSawdust} units of sawdust per day. A circular saw can cut \\var{CircularPlanks} planks of wood and produces \\var{CircularSawdust} units of sawdust per day. The woodshop must cut at least \\var{MinPlanks} planks of wood per day. However, to avoid too much pollution in the woodshop, they can produce at most \\var{MaxSawdust} units of sawdust per day.
