  "detailed_description": "A honey farmer sells his honey in glass and plastic jars. A glass jar can hold \\var{VolGlass} ml of honey while a plastic jar can hold \\var{VolPlastic} ml of honey. Since glass jars are more expensive, at least \\var{MinRatio} times as many plastic jars must be filled as glass jars. However, at least \\var{MinGlass} glass jars should be filled.
