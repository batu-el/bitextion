  "detailed_description": "A man on a strict diet only drinks meal replacement drinks from two brands, alpha and omega. The alpha brand drink contains \\param{ProteinAlpha} grams of protein, \\param{SugarAlpha} grams of sugar, and \\param{CaloriesAlpha} calories per bottle. The omega brand drink contains \\param{ProteinOmega} grams of protein, \\param{SugarOmega} grams of sugar, and \\param{CaloriesOmega} calories per bottle. The man wants to get at least \\param{MinProtein} grams of protein and \\param{MinCalories} calories. In addition, because the omega brand drink contains tiny amounts of caffeine, at most \\param{MaxPropOmega} of the drink should be omega brand.
