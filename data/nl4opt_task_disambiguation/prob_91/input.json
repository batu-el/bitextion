  "detailed_description": "A factory has two machines, A and B. Each day, machine A can make \\param{ItemsAMadePerDay} items and consumes \\param{ElectricityA} kWh. Machine B can make \\param{ItemsBMadePerDay} items and consumes \\param{ElectricityB} kWh per day. The factory must produce at least \\param{MinItems} items per day and has \\param{MaxElectricity} kWh of electricity available per day. Since there are not many workers that can operate both machines, at most \\param{MaxPercentB} of the machines must be of type B. Further, at least \\param{MinMachineA} machines of type A should be used. How many of each machine should be used to minimize the total number of machines?",
