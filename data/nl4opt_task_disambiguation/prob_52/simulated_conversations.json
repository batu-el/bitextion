  "detailed_description": "A sandwich company can open two types of stores, a dine-in place and a food-truck. A dine-in place can make \\var{DineInProd} sandwiches per day and requires \\var{DineInEmp} employees to operate. A food-truck can make \\var{FoodTruckProd} sandwiches per day and requires \\var{FoodTruckEmp} employees to operate. The company must make at least \\var{MinSandProd} sandwiches per day but they only have available \\var{TotalEmp} employees. How many of each type of store should the company open to minimize the total number of stores?",
