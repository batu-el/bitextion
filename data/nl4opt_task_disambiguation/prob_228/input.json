  "vague_description": "A large ski resort must decide how many of each type of ski lift to install in order to meet guest transport and electricity use requirements efficiently.",
  "detailed_description": "An extremely large ski resort is looking into purchasing two types of ski lifts, a densely-seated one and a loosely-seated one. The densely-seated ski lift is able to bring \\param{GuestsPerMinDense} guests up the slopes every minute whereas the loosely-seated ski lift can transport \\param{GuestsPerMinLoose} guests every minute. The densely-seated ski lift uses \\param{ElectricityDense} units of electricity and the loosely-seated lift uses \\param{ElectricityLoose} units of electricity. There must be at least \\param{MinLooseLifts} loosely-seated ski lifts because they move slower and are friendlier for beginners. The ski resort needs at least \\param{MinGuestsPerMin} guests every minute to make a profit and has available \\param{TotalElectricity} units of electricity. How many of each type of ski lifts should they plan to install to minimize the total number of ski lifts needed?",
