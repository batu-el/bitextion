  "detailed_description": "An extremely large ski resort is looking into purchasing two types of ski lifts, a densely-seated one and a loosely-seated one. The densely-seated ski lift is able to bring \\param{GuestsPerMinDense} guests up the slopes every minute whereas the loosely-seated ski lift can transport \\param{GuestsPerMinLoose} guests every minute. The densely-seated ski lift uses \\param{ElectricityDense} units of electricity and the loosely-seated lift uses \\param{ElectricityLoose} units of electricity. There must be at least \\param{MinLooseLifts} loosely-seated ski lifts because they move slower and are friendlier for beginners. The ski resort needs at least \\param{MinGuestsPerMin} guests every minute to make a profit and has available \\param{TotalElectricity} units of electricity. How many of each type of ski lifts should they plan to install to minimize the total number of ski lifts needed?",

    "Guests transported per minute by densely-seated and loosely-seated ski lifts combined is at least MinGuestsPerMin",
    "Electricity used by all ski lifts combined does not exceed TotalElectricity"
