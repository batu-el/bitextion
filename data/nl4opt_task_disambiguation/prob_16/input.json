  "detailed_description": "A company is deciding where to promote their product. Some options include z-tube, soorchle engine, and wassa advertisements. The cost for each option and the number of viewers they each attract is given. On z-tube, each ad costs \\$\\var{CostZtube} and attracts \\var{ViewersZtube} viewers. On soorchle, each ad costs \\$\\var{CostSoorchle} and attracts \\var{ViewersSoorchle} viewers. On wassa, each ad costs \\$\\var{CostWassa} and attracts \\var{ViewersWassa} viewers. Soorchle limits the number of advertisements from a single company to \\var{MaxAdsSoorchle}. Moreover, in order to balance the advertising among the three types of media, at most \\var{MaxPropWassa} of the total number of advertisements should occur on wassa. And at least \\var{MinPropZtube} should occur on z-tube. The weekly advertising budget is \\$\\var{Budget}.
