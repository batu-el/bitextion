  "vague_description": "A student needs to determine the optimal number of calcium and vitamin D pills to take each month in order to ensure effective absorption while minimizing the overall time required for efficacy.",
  "detailed_description": "A student takes calcium pills and vitamin D pills one after the other. Each calcium pill takes \\param{Tc} minutes to be effective while each vitamin D pill takes \\param{Td} minutes to be effective. Over a month, the student must take at least \\param{Pmin} pills of medication and at least \\param{Dmin} should be vitamin D pills because they enhance the absorption of calcium in the body. Since vitamin D is complimentary to calcium, the student must take more calcium pills than vitamin D pills. How many pills of each should the student take to minimize the total time it takes for the medication to be effective?",

    "Number of calcium pills is non-negative",
    "Number of vitamin D pills is non-negative",
    "Total number of pills taken must be at least Pmin",
    "Number of vitamin D pills taken must be at least Dmin",
    "Number of calcium pills must be greater than the number of vitamin D pills"

    "Effective time for each calcium pill",
    "Effective time for each vitamin D pill",
