  "detailed_description": "A hospital prepares batches of medication patches and anti-biotic creams. Each medication patch requires \\param{TimeMedicationPatches} minutes to prepare and \\param{MaterialsMedicationPatches} units of materials. Each anti-biotic cream requires \\param{TimeAntiBioticCreams} minutes to prepare and \\param{MaterialsAntiBioticCreams} units of materials. Since anti-biotic creams are used more often, there must be at least twice as many anti-biotic creams as medication patches. Due to storage reasons, the hospital can make at most \\param{MaxTotalBatches} batches of medication patches and anti-biotic creams in total. The hospital has available \\param{TotalStaffTime} minutes of staff to spare and \\param{TotalMaterials} units of materials. If each batch of medication patches can treat \\param{PeopleTreatedMedicationPatches} people and each batch of anti-biotic cream can treat \\param{PeopleTreatedAntiBioticCreams} people, how many batches of each should be made to maximize the number of people that can be treated?",
