  "detailed_description": "A large fishing boat sends fish back to shore either by small canoes or smaller diesel boats. A canoe can carry back \\param{CanoeCapacity} fish while a small diesel boat can carry back \\param{DieselBoatCapacity} fish. In order to follow environmental rules, the number of small canoes used has to be at least \\param{CanoesPerDieselBoat} times as many as the number of diesel boats used. If at least \\param{MinimumFishToTransport} fish need to be transported to shore, minimize the total number of canoes and diesel boats needed.",
