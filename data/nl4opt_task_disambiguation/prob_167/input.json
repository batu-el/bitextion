  "vague_description": "The challenge is to efficiently transport a specified quantity of ore using minimum wagons without breaching wagon ratio constraints.",
  "detailed_description": "A mine sends ore to the surface in small and large wagons. A small wagon holds \\param{SmallWagonCapacity} units of ore while a large wagon holds \\param{LargeWagonCapacity} units of ore. To avoid taking up too much space on the ramps, the number of small wagons must be at least \\param{MinRatioSmallToLarge} times as much as the number of large wagons. In addition, at least \\param{MinLargeWagons} large wagons must be used. If \\param{TotalOre} units of ore need to be taken to the surface, minimize the total number of wagons needed.",
