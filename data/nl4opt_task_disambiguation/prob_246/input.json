  "detailed_description": "A lighting company has access to two types of lights to provide their customers, an LED fixture, and a fluorescence lamp. The LED light uses \\param{ELed} units of electricity per hour and needs to be changed \\param{NLed} times a decade. Conversely, the fluorescence lamp uses \\param{EFluorescence} units of electricity per hour and needs to be changed \\param{NFluorescence} times a decade. Due to previous installations, at least \\param{PFluorescence} implemented lights must be fluorescence lamps. If the customer requires at least \\param{MinLights} light fixtures and can use at most \\param{MaxElectricity} units of electricity, how many of each light should be installed to reduce the total number of light changes?",
