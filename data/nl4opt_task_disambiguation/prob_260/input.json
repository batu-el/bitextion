  "detailed_description": "A research group is making fabric and plastic using two methods, method A and method B. Method A produces \\param{FabricA} units of fabric and \\param{PlasticA} units of plastic per hour. Method B produces \\param{FabricB} units of fabric and \\param{PlasticB} units of plastic per hour. Method A requires \\param{ElementA} units of a special element while method B requires \\param{ElementB} units of the same special element. The research group has \\param{TotalElement} units of the special element and must make at least \\param{MinFabric} units of fabric and \\param{MinPlastic} units of plastic.
