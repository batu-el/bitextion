  "detailed_description": "A soda company sells soda in two types of containers: cans and glass bottles. A can holds \\param{CanVolume} ml of soda whereas a glass bottle holds \\param{BottleVolume} ml of soda. The soda company needs to bottle at least \\param{MinTotalVolume} ml of soda every day and due to the ability to sell soda cans as packs, there must be at least \\param{CanBottleRatio} times more cans than glass bottles. However, because of previous contracts with gas stations, there must be at least \\param{MinBottles} glass bottles made. How many of each should be made to maximize the total number of units produced?",

    "Volume of soda a can holds",
