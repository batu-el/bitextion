  "detailed_description": "A concert organizer has to transport equipment using carts or trolleys. Carts can transport \\param{CartRate} kg/min of equipment and requires \\param{CartWorkers} workers. Trolleys can transport \\param{TrolleyRate} kg/min of equipment and requires \\param{TrolleyWorkers} workers. There must be at least \\param{MinTrolleys} trolleys to be used. Additionally, only a maximum of \\param{MaxTrolleyPercentage} of the transportation can be using trolleys. The organizer has to deliver at a rate of \\param{DeliveryRate} kg/min of equipment.
