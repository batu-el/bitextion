  "detailed_description": "Both chemical A and chemical B need to be added to a mixer for making bread. One unit of chemical A takes \\param{TimeA} seconds to be effective while one unit of chemical B takes \\param{TimeB} seconds to be effective. Because chemical A can be dangerous, there has to be at most \\param{MaxRatioAtoB} as much chemical A as chemical B in the mixer. If there has to be at least \\param{MinUnitsA} units of chemical A in the mixer and at least \\param{MinTotalUnits} units of total chemicals in the mixer, how many units of each should be added to minimize the total time it takes for the mixed bread to be ready?",

  "target_constraints": [
    "Number of units of chemical A is non-negative",
    "Number of units of chemical B is non-negative",
    "For every unit of chemical B, there can be at most MaxRatioAtoB units of chemical A",
    "At least MinUnitsA units of chemical A must be present in the mixer",
    "The total number of units in the mixer must be at least MinTotalUnits"
