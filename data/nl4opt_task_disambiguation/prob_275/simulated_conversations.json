  "detailed_description": "Both chemical A and chemical B need to be added to a mixer for making bread. One unit of chemical A takes \\param{TimeA} seconds to be effective while one unit of chemical B takes \\param{TimeB} seconds to be effective. Because chemical A can be dangerous, there has to be at most \\param{MaxRatioAtoB} as much chemical A as chemical B in the mixer.
