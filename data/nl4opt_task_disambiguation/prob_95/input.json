  "detailed_description": "A mining company has available a total of \\param{A} square miles of mining sites and considering the use of two mining techniques: heap leaching and vat leaching. For each square mile of land, heap leaching technique can have a daily production of \\param{HeapProduction} tons of rare earth oxide per square miles but it also creates \\param{HeapWaste} tons of polluted wastewater and requires \\param{HeapMachines} extraction machines. On the other hand, vat leaching technique produces \\param{VatProduction} tons of rare earth oxide per square miles per day while creating \\param{VatWaste} tons of polluted wastewater and requiring \\param{VatMachines} extraction machines. There are \\param{MachinesAvailable} machines available and due to environmental regulations, the amount of polluted wastewater must be at most \\param{WasteLimit} tons daily.
