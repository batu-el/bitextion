  "detailed_description": "A new fast food place makes wraps and platters. Each wrap requires \\var{MeatWrap} units of meat and \\var{RiceWrap} units of rice. Each platter requires \\var{MeatPlatter} units of meant and \\var{RicePlatter} units of rice. While each wrap takes \\var{TimeWrap} minutes to make, each platter takes \\var{TimePlatter} minutes to make. The fast food place must use at least \\var{MinMeat} units of meat and \\var{MinRice} units of rice. Since wraps are easier to eat on the go, at least \\var{RatioWrapPlatter} times as many wraps need to be made as platter.
