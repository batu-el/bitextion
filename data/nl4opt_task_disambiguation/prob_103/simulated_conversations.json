  "detailed_description": "An dog hospital has \\param{TotalMedication} units of tooth medication to make both small and large bones. A small bone requires \\param{SmallMedication} units of tooth medication and \\param{SmallMeat} units of meat. A large bone requires \\param{LargeMedication} units of tooth medication and \\param{LargeMeat} units of meat. Since most dogs prefer the small bones, at least \\param{MinSmallBonePercentage} of the bones made must be small. In addition, the hospital must make at least \\param{MinLargeBones} large bones.
