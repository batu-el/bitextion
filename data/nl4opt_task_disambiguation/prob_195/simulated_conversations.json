A carrier pigeon can carry \\param{CarrierCapacity} letters at a time and requires \\param{TreatsPerCarrier} treats for service. An owl can carry \\param{OwlCapacity} letters at a time and requires \\param{TreatsPerOwl} treats for service. At most \\param{MaxOwlPercentage} of the birds can be owls.
