  "detailed_description": "A recycling company collects recycling from neighborhoods using small and large bins. A small bin requires \\param{SmallBinWorkers} workers while a large bin requires \\param{LargeBinWorkers} workers. A small bin can hold \\param{SmallBinCapacity} units of recycling material and a large bin can hold \\param{LargeBinCapacity} units of recycling material. The company has available \\param{TotalWorkers} workers. Because most people don't recycle, the number of small bins must be \\param{BinRatio} times the number of large bins.
