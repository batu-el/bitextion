  "detailed_description": "A biotechnology company has AntibioticsAvailable units of antibiotics available which is important to the process of making a first-dose and second-dose of vaccines. The first-dose vaccine requires AntibioticsFirstDose units of antibiotics and GelatineFirstDose mg of gelatine whereas the second-dose vaccine requires AntibioticsSecondDose units of antibiotics and GelatineSecondDose mg of gelatine. Since the first-dose vaccine is required before the second-dose vaccine, there must be more first-dose than second-dose vaccines manufactured. However, at least MinimumSecondDose second-dose vaccines must be made. How many of each vaccine should be made to minimize the amount of gelatine used?",
