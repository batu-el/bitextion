Per dose, medicine A takes \\param{MaterialA} units of imported material and \\param{MrnaA} units of mRNA to make. Per dose, medicine B takes \\param{MaterialB} units of imported material and \\param{MrnaB} units of mRNA to take. The lab has available at most \\param{TotalMaterial} units of imported material and \\param{TotalMrna} units of mRNA. The lab can make at most \\param{MaxDosesA} doses of medicine A and the number of doses of medicine B must be larger than the number of doses of medicine A.
