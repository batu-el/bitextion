  "detailed_description": "Determine a strategy to minimize costs from unloading (\\param{UnloadCosts}), storage (\\param{HoldingCost}), and crane rentals (\\param{CraneCost}) over the period. The demands over the time periods are given by \\param{Demands}, with a corresponding unloading capacity per period specified by \\param{UnloadCapacity}. The system starts with an initial inventory of containers given by \\param{InitContainer}, and the maximum container inventory is limited to \\param{MaxContainer}. The logistics also involve \\param{NumCranes} number of cranes with \\param{CraneCapacity} each to aid in the unloading process.",
