They have a set target of \\param{GoalYoung} clicks by young individuals, \\param{GoalOld} clicks by old individuals, \\param{GoalUniqueYoung} unique clicks by young, and \\param{GoalUniqueOld} unique clicks by old. They can gather clicks from a total of A different ad types. Each ad type provides a varying number of clicks by young individuals \\param{YoungClicks} and by old individuals \\param{OldClicks}. Each ad type also incurs different costs \\param{Costs}, has a maximum limit for the number of clicks \\param{MaxClicks}, and provides a number of unique clicks \\param{UniqueClicks}.
