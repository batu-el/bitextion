  "detailed_description": "How should the manufacture manage the steel to maximize profit? The manufacture has to decide on the optimal quantity of \\param{SteelQuantity} tons of steel to produce, taking into account the required \\param{ManganesePercent} percent manganese and ensuring the silicon content is between \\param{SiliconMinPercent} percent and \\param{SiliconMaxPercent} percent. The available stocks contain \\param{SiliconContent} percent Silicon and \\param{ManganeseContent} percent Manganese. The price of manganese is set at \\param{ManganesePrice} per ton, and the material cost for each stock is \\param{MaterialCost}. The company sells the steel at a price of \\param{SellingPrice} per ton but also incurs a melting cost of \\param{MeltingPrice} per ton.",
