Requirement are given as \\param{K} different resources each having \\param{I} specific requirements, where \\param{Strength} is the strength of each type of resource, \\param{LessOneWaste} is the value when wastage of resources is less than optimal, \\param{MoreOneWaste} is the value when wastage of resources is more than optimal. \\param{Recruit} is the number of recruited resources of each type, \\param{CostRedundancy} is the cost of redundancy for each type of resource, \\param{NumOverman} signifies the number of overmanned positions, \\param{CostOverman} is the cost of overmanning for each type of resource, and \\param{NumShortwork} represents the number of shortworked positions with \\param{CostShort} as the cost of short working for each type of resource.
