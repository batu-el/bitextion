  "detailed_description": "The company\u2019s declared objective is to minimize costs. It has \\param{K} categories of requirements, with each category consisting of \\param{I} different requirements. The strength of each requirement category is denoted by \\param{Strength}, whereas the cost reductions per unit less waste in each category and the additional costs per unit more waste in each category are represented by \\param{LessOneWaste} and \\param{MoreOneWaste}, respectively. The number of recruits in each category is given by \\param{Recruit}, and the cost of redundancy per recruit in each category is \\param{CostRedundancy}. The company can allow \\param{NumOverman} over-managed categories, with each over-managed category incurring a cost of \\param{CostOverman}. Similarly, \\param{NumShortwork} short-work categories are permissible, each one resulting in a cost of \\param{CostShort}. How should they operate in order to minimize these costs?",
