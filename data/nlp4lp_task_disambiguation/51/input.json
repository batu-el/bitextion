  "detailed_description": "How much regular and overtime labor should be utilized each week to assemble the baskets to maximize the profit over the season? The costs for regular and overtime labor are \\param{RegularCost} and \\param{OvertimeCost}, respectively.

Baskets are sold at \\param{SellingPrice}, with a holding cost of \\param{HoldingCost} and a salvage value of \\param{SalvageValue} at the end of the season.
