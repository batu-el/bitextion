  "detailed_description": "Consider a diet problem. Given a set of \\param{FoodNum} foods and a set of \\param{NutrientNum}. Each food \\param{j} has a cost \\param{CostPerFood_j} and the amount of each nutrient \\param{i} it contains is \\param{AmountPerNutrient_{i,j}}. The problem aims to minimize the total cost of buying foods. It is constrained that the total amount of each nutrient \\param{i} with minimum requirements in the foods bought is at least \\param{MinReqAmount_i} and the total amount of each nutrient \\param{i} with maximum requirements in the foods bought is at most \\param{MaxReqAmount_i}.
