  "detailed_description": "The Aircraft Landing Problem (ALP) is the problem of deciding a landing time on an appropriate runway for each aircraft in a given set of \\param{TotalAircrafts} aircraft such that each aircraft lands within a predetermined time window defined by an \\param{EarliestLandingTime} and a \\param{LatestLandingTime}; and separation criteria between the landing of an aircraft i, and the landing of all successive aircraft j, are respected, determined by \\param{SeparationTimeMatrix}. Each aircraft has a \\param{TargetLandingTime}, and penalties are incurred for landing after (\\param{PenaltyTimeAfterTarget}) or before (\\param{PenaltyTimeBeforeTarget}) this target time.",
