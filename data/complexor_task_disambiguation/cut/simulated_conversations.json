  "detailed_description": "This is a cutting stock problem. Given a roll of width \\param{RollWidth} and a set of \\param{NumWidths} widths \\param{Widths} to be cut. Each width i has a certain number of orders \\param{Orders_i}. There are \\param{NumPatterns} patterns and each pattern j has a certain number of rolls of each width i \\param{NumRollsWidthPattern_{i,j}}.
