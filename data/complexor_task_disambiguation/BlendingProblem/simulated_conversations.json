  "detailed_description": "The goal is to minimize the price of an alloy produced from other alloys available on the market. There are \\param{AlloysOnMarket} different alloys that can be bought to blend into the final product. The needed composition of the end alloy requires \\param{RequiredElements} elements. Each alloy on the market has a known composition given by \\param{CompositionDataPercentage_{e,a}}, which indicates the percentage of element e in alloy a. The desired percentage of each element in the final blend is specified by \\param{DesiredBlendPercentage_e}. Furthermore, each alloy a on the market comes with a price \\param{AlloyPrice_a}.
