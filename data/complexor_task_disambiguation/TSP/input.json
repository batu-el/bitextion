  "detailed_description": "The optimization problem is focused on efficiently allocating goods from a set of origins, denoted by \\param{OriginNum}, to a set of destinations, represented by \\param{DestinationNum}. Each originating point has a certain supply of goods, \\param{Supply_i}, where i is an origin. Correspondingly, each destination point has a specific demand, \\param{Demand_j}, where j is a destination. The cost associated with sending goods from origin i to destination j is represented by \\param{Cost_{i,j}}. The objective is to minimize the total transportation cost while meeting the demands at the destinations without exceeding the supplies at the origins.",

  "target_constraints": [
    "Each origin i (where i is an index for origins) has a supply limit of Supply_i",
    "Each destination j (where j is an index for destinations) requires Demand_j amount of goods",
    "Amount of goods sent from any origin to any destination is non-negative"
  ],
  "target_parameters": [
    "The total number of origins",
    "The total number of destinations",
    "The supply of goods available at each origin",
    "The demand for goods to be satisfied at each destination",
