  "detailed_description": "The optimization problem is focused on efficiently allocating goods from a set of origins, denoted by \\param{OriginNum}, to a set of destinations, represented by \\param{DestinationNum}. Each originating point has a certain supply of goods, \\param{Supply_i}, where i is an origin. Correspondingly, each destination point has a specific demand, \\param{Demand_j}, where j is a destination. The cost associated with sending goods from origin i to destination j is represented by \\param{Cost_{i,j}}. The objective is to minimize the total transportation cost while meeting the demands at the destinations without exceeding the supplies at the origins.",
