  "detailed_description": "The capacitated warehouse location problem is the problem of locating \\param{NumberOfLocations} warehouses which have to service \\param{NumberOfCustomers} customers, at minimum cost. Each customer has an associated demand \\param{CustomerDemand}. There are constraints on the total demand that can be met from a warehouse, as specified by \\param{WarehouseCapacity}. Costs are incurred when allocating service to customers from warehouses \\param{ServiceAllocationCost}, and warehouses have a fixed operating cost \\param{WarehouseFixedCost}. Additionally, there is a lower limit \\param{MinimumDemandFromWarehouse} on the amount of demand that a warehouse must meet if it is opened, as well as constraints on the minimum \\param{MinimumOpenWarehouses} and maximum \\param{MaximumOpenWarehouses} number of warehouses that can be operational.",
