  "detailed_description": "The Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW) involves the distribution of goods between depots and customers using \\param{VehicleCount} vehicles. Each vehicle has to supply \\param{CustomerCount} customers, and has a limited capacity, \\param{VehicleCapacity_i}, for each vehicle i. Each customer, j, has an associated demand, \\param{CustomerDemand_j}, that must be satisfied within the customer-specific time window, defined by the lower and upper bounds, \\param{CustomerLBTW_j} and \\param{CustomerUBTW_j}, respectively. The \\param{CustomerDistance_{i,j}} parameter represents the distance between customer i to customer j, and \\param{CustomerServiceTime_j} denotes the service time for customer j.",
