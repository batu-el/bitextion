The availability for each aircraft i is \\param{Availability_i} and it represents the maximum number of routes that the aircraft can be assigned to. The demand for each route j is \\param{Demand_j} and it denotes the number of aircraft required to fulfill the passenger or cargo needs of the route. The capability of each aircraft i for each route j is given by \\param{Capacity_{i,j}} and it defines whether the aircraft can service the route, considering factors such as range, size, and suitability.
