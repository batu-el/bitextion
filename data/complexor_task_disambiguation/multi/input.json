  "vague_description": "The task is to optimally allocate limited resources to meet multiple demands while minimizing transport costs across a network of locations.",
  "detailed_description": "This is a multi-commodity transportation problem. Given a set of origins \\param{OriginNum}, a set of destinations \\param{DestinationNum}, and a set of products \\param{ProductNum}. Each origin i has a certain supply of each product p, \\param{Supply}_{i,p}, and each destination j has a certain demand for each product p, \\param{Demand}_{j,p}. The cost of shipping one unit of product p from origin i to destination j is \\param{Cost}_{i, j, p}. The problem aims to minimize the total cost of shipping all products from the origins to the destinations. It is constrained that the total amount of each product p shipped from each origin i equals its supply, the total amount of each product p shipped to each destination j equals its demand, and the total amount of all products shipped from each origin i to each destination j does not exceed a certain limit \\param{Limit}_{i,j}. The decision variable is the number of units of each product p to be shipped from each origin i to each destination j.",
