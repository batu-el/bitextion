  "detailed_description": "The Car Selection Problem is a mixed integer programming model that aims to assign \\param{ParticipantNum} participants to \\param{CarNum} cars in a way that maximizes the total number of assignments. Each participant is interested in a subset of cars, represented by \\param{InterestMatrix_{p,c}}, where p and c index participants and cars, respectively. The objective is to find the optimal assignment of participants to cars that satisfies certain constraints.",
  "target_objective": "Maximize the total number of participant-to-car assignments",
  "target_constraints": [
    "Each participant is assigned to at most one car",
    "A participant can only be assigned to a car if they are interested in that car (InterestMatrix_{p,c} = 1)",
    "The assignment of a participant to a car is a binary decision (either 0 or 1)"
  ],

    "The total number of participants",
    "The total number of available cars",
    "A binary matrix indicating whether a participant is interested in a particular car (1 for interested and 0 for not interested)"
