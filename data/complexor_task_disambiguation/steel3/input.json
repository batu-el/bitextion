  "detailed_description": "Consider a production problem. Given a set of products \\param{ProductNum}. Each product p is produced at a rate of \\param{ProductionRate_p} tons per hour. There are \\param{AvailableHours} hours available in a week. The profit per ton for each product p is \\param{ProfitPerTon_p}. There is a lower limit \\param{MinimumSale_p} and an upper limit \\param{MaximumSale_p} on the tons of each product p sold in a week. The problem aims to maximize the total profit from selling all products. It is constrained that the total of hours used by all products may not exceed the hours available. How to decide the tons of each product p to be produced?",
