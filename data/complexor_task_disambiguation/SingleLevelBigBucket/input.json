  "vague_description": "A business needs to determine how to efficiently manage production schedules for items given limited capacity and varying demand while minimizing associated costs.",
  "detailed_description": "Lot-sizing problems are production planning problems where \\param{Periods} are predefined and production of an item during a \\param{Periods} involves a discrete event such as the payment of a cost or the loss of production capacity. These events can occur due to the placement of an order or the set-up, startup, or changeover of a machine. The demand for each of the \\param{Items} across each period is represented by \\param{Demand_{i,j}}, while the total production capacity available in each period is defined by \\param{TotalPeriodCapacity_j}. Each item has a specific capacity \\param{ItemCapacity_{i,j}} which could decrease in each period due to mentioned events. Holding costs for items are indicated by \\param{HoldingCost_i}, while backorder costs and fixed order costs are represented by \\param{BackorderCost_i} and \\param{FixedCost_i}, respectively. The initial stock of each item is provided by \\param{InitialStock_i}.",

    "Number of items produced must meet the demand for each item in each period",
    "Total production must not exceed the available capacity for each period",
    "Each item has a specific capacity that might decrease in each period",
    "Production amounts, initial stock, and holding costs for each item are non-negative",
    "Backorder costs and fixed order costs for each item are non-negative",
    "Holding costs are incurred on any unsold stock carried over to subsequent periods",
    "Backorder costs are incurred if the demand is not met on time",
    "A fixed cost is incurred every time an order is placed or a machine is set-up or changed over"
