Considering potential facility locations and customer zones as fixed points in a network, each facility has a fixed \\param{FacilityFixedCost} and a \\param{FacilityCapacity}. Furthermore, there exists a \\param{CustomerDemand} for each customer zone, and a \\param{FacilityToCustomerTransportCost} representing the cost of transport between facilities and customer zones.",

    "Each facility has a maximum capacity of FacilityCapacity",
    "Total number of facilities to be located is NumberOfFacilities",
    "Each customer zone is served by at least one facility and its demand must be met",
