  "detailed_description": "Consider a production problem. Given a set of products \\param{NumProducts} and a set of stages \\param{NumStages}. Each product p has a certain production rate \\param{ProductionRate_{p,s}} in each stage s and a certain profit \\param{ProfitPerTon_p} per ton. Each stage s has a certain number of hours \\param{StageAvailability_s} available per week. There are also lower and upper limits on the tons of each product sold in a week, \\param{MinCommitment_p} and \\param{MaxMarketLimit_p} respectively. The problem aims to maximize the total profit from all products. It is constrained that the total number of hours used by all products in each stage s may not exceed the hours available. How to decide the number of tons to be produced for each product p?",
