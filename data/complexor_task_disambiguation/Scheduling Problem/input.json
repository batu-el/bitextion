  "detailed_description": "The Employee Assignment Problem is a scheduling problem where the goal is to assign \\param{NumEmployees} employees to \\param{NumShifts} shifts in \\param{NumRestaurants} different restaurants based on their skills and preferences. Each employee has a set of skills out of \\param{NumSkills} possible skills, and each restaurant has a demand for skilled employees during each shift. The objective is to minimize the cost of the schedule, which includes the cost of unfulfilled positions (each weighted by \\param{UnfulfilledPositionWeight}) and the cost of assigning employees to less preferred positions (indicated by their preference levels for each skill).",
